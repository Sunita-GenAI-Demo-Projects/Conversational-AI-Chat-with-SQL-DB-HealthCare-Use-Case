# Conversational-AI-Chat-with-SQL-DB-HealthCare-Use-Case

**** GenAI : Conversational Chat with SQL Database – HealthCare Use-Case ****     
This project demonstrates the power of Conversational AI for Business use-cases such as DIY/ Self-Serve Reporting, Schema Description, Customer or User Learning

**** Description: ****      
This project demonstrates the usage of Conversational AI-agent to solve a business situation of a Healthcare company. This AI-agent understands customer question, analyses the business situation, queries the database and summarizes the output based on prompt engineering. 

**** Scenario: ****      
A Healthcare company identified that customers are curious about diet and nutrition and have lots of questions in this topic. The goal for this company is to increase nutrition-awareness among customers, which then leads to leads to more Customer Engagement and finally higher Satisfaction Score (NPS). The company then deploys Conversational AI-Agent to respond to these questions using company’s Proprietary Nutrition data.

**** Data: ****     
Proprietary data of this Healthcare company contains information such as Caloric Value, Dietary fiber, Protein, Vitamins, Minerals, Nutrition density on thousands of food items consumed world-wide.

**** Features: ****     
Healthcare company has volumes of nutrition data (csv files).
This code reads the csv files and stores them in SQL DB.
Customer enters the question regarding nutritional value for food items in the console prompt.
I created an AI-Agent which understands the question and responds to customer in conversational language.
This AI-agent reads the question, which is then transformed into SQL query and queries from SQL DB.
AI-Agent responds to the customer in natural language with the query response. 
Customer continues to chat with the Agent to learn more on nutritional value of food.

**** Output: ****     
This code generates responses in natural language to the customers’ nutritional questions.

**** Benefits: ****     
•	This code demonstrates how to chat with SQL/ relational database to solve business use-cases, such as reporting. 
•	This code also demonstrates possibility of DIY/ Self-Serve Reporting, Schema Description, Customer or User Learning using AI-agents

**** Technology used: ****      
OpenAI (gpt LLM), LangChain, GenAI, Python, Prompt Engineering, SQL
